    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <p>
      As a multimedia artist and full-stack developer, I bridge the gap between technology 
      and creative expression. My journey spans over four years of development experience, 
      from crafting interactive digital experiences to engineering AI-integrated applications.
      While my technical expertise lies in Unity/C# development and Python applications, 
      a true passion emerges through traditional art formsâ€”painting and drawing serve as 
      my primary means of exploration and expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background in multimedia design and creative technology has shaped my unique approach 
      to both digital and traditional art. With expertise in the Adobe Creative Suite and 
      3D modeling software, I bring a versatile skill set to every project. Whether I'm 
      developing interactive experiences, creating motion graphics, or working with 
      traditional media, I'm constantly seeking new ways to push creative boundaries 
      and explore the intersection of art and technology.
